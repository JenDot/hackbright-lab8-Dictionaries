"""Restaurant rating lister.
Your job is to write a program named ratings.py that:

    Reads the ratings from the file

    Stores them in a dictionary

    And finally, spits out the ratings in alphabetical order by restaurant

Hint 1: Using .items() to get a list of your dictionary entries will help with sorting.

Hint 2: Refer to the Python docs on the sorted() function if you need a reminder of how to sort.
